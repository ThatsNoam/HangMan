# Hangman Game
This is a simple command-line Hangman game implemented in Java. The game allows players to guess letters to uncover a hidden word. If the player guesses the word within a certain number of incorrect attempts, they win the game. Otherwise, they lose.

# How to Play
Run the Hangman class from your Java IDE or command line.
The game will choose a random word for you to guess.
You'll see a series of dashes representing the letters in the word.
You can guess letters by entering them one at a time.
If your guessed letter is correct, it will be revealed in the word. If not, a part of the hangman will be drawn.
Keep guessing letters until you either guess the word correctly or make too many incorrect guesses.
You win if you guess the word, and you lose if the hangman is completely drawn.
